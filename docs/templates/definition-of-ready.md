# Definition of Ready

A ticket in the backlog can be picked up by a developer only if it meets:

- All stories must meet the INVEST criteria
  - Independent
  - Negotiable
  - Valuable
  - Estimable
  - Small
  - Testable
- A clearly defined user
- An estimate of the effort required to complete the story
- Acceptance criteria in a certain format such as "given..., when..., then..."
- User journeys that provide context
- Screen mockups, Architectural drawings or flows
- Optional,business rules

Make sure the backlog items have enough clarity so that the delivery teams are
able to make a commitment for delivering items within a sprint. This is
specifics to an organization, and for sure it can evolve.
